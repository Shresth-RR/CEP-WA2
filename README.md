CEP-WA2
🌌 Solar System Simulation – Field Trip Project
This is an interactive solar system simulation created using p5.js, inspired by the "Field Trip" theme. The project is designed to visualize real(ish) physics such as gravitational attraction, orbital mechanics, and the concept of black holes.

🪐 Features
🌞 A central sun with gravitational pull
🌍 User-generated planets that orbit the sun
✨ Starry background with two animated glowing stars
🕳️ Press C or c to combine the two stars into a black hole that:
Attracts planets using inverse-square gravity
Swallows up to 5 planets, then disappears
📆 Year counter starting from 2025 AD, increasing every second
🖱️ Click to add new planets at your cursor's position
🎓 Clean OOP architecture using multiple JavaScript classes
📂 Project Structure
💻 Controls
Click: Add a new planet at the mouse position
C key: Trigger star fusion to form a black hole
Top Left: On-screen instructions
Top Right: Live year counter (starting from 2025 AD)
🧠 Science Lens
The simulation is inspired by gravitational physics, simulating:

Newtonian orbital mechanics (inverse-square law)
A black hole-like attractor with strong localized gravity
Orbital speeds depend on distance from the sun
This is an educational visualization to demonstrate force interactions and dynamic systems.

Made by Shresth Daga for the RI Y3CEP Weighted Assessment 2 (15% of yearly grade).
